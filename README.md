# AcademicPages-style Starter (Simplified)

This is a lightweight Jekyll site inspired by the AcademicPages structure.  
It keeps the familiar folders (`_pages`, `files`, `images`, `assets`) but avoids Ruby plugins, so it works out-of-the-box on GitHub Pages.

## How to use
1. Create a public repo named **`YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`**.
2. Upload these files to the repo (or push via git).
3. Replace placeholder text in `_pages` and `index.md`.
4. Put your CV at `files/CV.pdf`.
5. Your site will appear at **https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io** shortly.

_Notes:_ This is not the full AcademicPages theme; it's a simplified layout that doesn't require additional gems. You can later switch to the full template if you want all features.
