I am Sixing Chen (Chinese: 陈思行), a third-year Ph.D. student in Psychology at New York University, where I work with [Marcelo Mattar](https://www.mattarlab.com/). I study how people plan and reason to solve problems using a combination of computational modeling and behavioral experiments.

Previously, I completed my B.S. in Psychology at Peking University, working with [Hang Zhang](https://mgv.pku.edu.cn/english/people/lbd/sopacs/220156.htm) and [Dobromir Rahnev](https://psychology.gatech.edu/people/dobromir-rahnev) on computational models of uncertainty representation and perceptual decision-making.
